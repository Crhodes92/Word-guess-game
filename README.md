# Psychic Guess Game

This project is a fun little game where you try to guess the exact word that a computer does

This project was a way for me to flex my javascript muscles. It's my first real implementation of javascript on my own and I'm really proud of how it came together. 

You can get started by simply guessing a word on your keyboard. 

If you run into any issues feel free to shoot me an email at Crhodes2146@gmail.com

I'll be updating this and maintaining it as I learn more.
